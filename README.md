# VibeCheck-2026
VibeCheck 2026 is a modular "Life-OS" designed for the transition from holiday chaos to professional clarity. Built for the 2025 Christmas Hackathon, this application uses a Glassmorphism UI to help users visualize the most precious currency they have: Time
The app features a "Bipolar UI"—a single toggle that transforms the experience from a festive, eggnog-fueled Christmas Chaos dashboard into a high-performance Executive Life-OS.

At its core, VibeCheck 2026 isn't just a to-do list; it’s an analytical engine. By mapping "silly" metrics (like holiday spirit) to "serious" parameters (like deep-work efficiency), it provides a predictive look at your coming year. With its built-in Existential Life-Clock, it serves as a beautiful, Pinterest-inspired reminder that while 2026 is full of potential, the clock is always ticking.


🛠️ The Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based) with custom CSS injection.

Design Language: Glassmorphism.

Data Engine: Pandas & NumPy for life-expectancy math.

Visuals: Plotly Interactive Charts & Lucide Icons.

## 💡 The Problem: "The December-January Split"
We suffer from a unique productivity condition. Half of our brain is panicking about Q1 KPIs and "New Year, New Me" goals. The other half is still eating leftover pie and watching.

Most productivity apps force you to choose one. **VibeCheck** lets you be both.

## 🚀 What is VibeCheck?
VibeCheck is a **Dual-Mode Dashboard** that adapts to your psychological state. It uses a **State-Driven UI Engine** to swap your reality instantly between "Holiday Chaos" and "Executive Strategy."

### 🎨 The Dual Modes

| Feature | 🎅 Silly Mode (Holiday) | 💼 Pro Mode (Executive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Survive & vibe. | Execute & dominate. |
| **Fuel Metric** | Eggnog (Liters) 🥛 | Caffeine (mg) ☕ |
| **Y-Axis Metric** | Chaos Level (%) 🌀 | Productivity (%) 📈 |
| **Visuals** | Pink Gradients + Falling Snow ❄️ | Blue Glass + Tech Pulse 🔮 |
| **AI Judgment** | "Delusional", "Baby Steps" | "High Impact", "Strategic" |

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔮 Advanced Glassmorphism UI
I implemented a custom CSS injection engine to create **frosted glass cards** (`backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`). The UI feels premium, modern, and highly responsive.

### 🎭 The Resolution Court
A fully interactive module where you input your goals, assign a timeline (Dec-Jun), and rate their difficulty.
* **Smart Labeling:** The app "judges" your goal based on the current mode. A hard goal is "Legendary" in Pro mode, but "Delusional" in Silly mode.
* **Mutable List:** You can **Edit** typos and **Delete** tasks that become too overwhelming.

### 🎬 CSS Animation Engine
* **Silly Mode:** Generates 3 layers of randomized, parallax "Snowballs" using pure CSS keyframes.
* **Pro Mode:** Activates a subtle "Tech Pulse" breathing effect on all data cards to signify active processing.

### 📊 Dynamic Data Visualization
Uses **Plotly Express** to render interactive charts. The charts react to the toggle, completely changing their data, color scales, and axis labels (Chaos vs. Productivity) in real-time without a page reload.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python:** Core logic and state management.
* **Streamlit:** Frontend framework and session state handling.
* **Plotly Graph Objects:** For the custom "Momentum Gauge" and Bar Charts.
* **CSS3:** For the animations, gradients, and glassmorphism effects.
