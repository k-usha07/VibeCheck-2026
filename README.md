# VibeCheck-2026
VibeCheck 2026 is a modular "Life-OS" designed for the transition from holiday chaos to professional clarity. Built for the 2025 Christmas Hackathon, this application uses a Bento Grid UI to help users visualize the most precious currency they have: Time
The app features a "Bipolar UI"—a single toggle that transforms the experience from a festive, eggnog-fueled Christmas Chaos dashboard into a high-performance Executive Life-OS.

At its core, VibeCheck 2026 isn't just a to-do list; it’s an analytical engine. By mapping "silly" metrics (like holiday spirit) to "serious" parameters (like deep-work efficiency), it provides a predictive look at your coming year. With its built-in Existential Life-Clock, it serves as a beautiful, Pinterest-inspired reminder that while 2026 is full of potential, the clock is always ticking.
